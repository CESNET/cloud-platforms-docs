## Create Key Pair

All virtual machine instances running in the cloud have to be accessed remotely. The most common way of accessing
an instance remotely is SSH. Using SSH requires a pair of keys - a public key and a private key.

<Tabs items={["CLI", "GUI"]}>
    <Tab value="CLI">
        <Callout type="info" title="Note" icon="📌">
            Prefer using this method if possible. It is the most secure one, since your private key is kept
            on your local machine at all times.
        </Callout>


        <Callout type="info" title="Note" icon="📌">
            You will need the `ssh-keygen` command present on your machine. It is available as a part of SSH-related
            packages in most Linux distributions:

            * Debian / Ubuntu: `openssh-client`
            * RHEL / Fedora: `openssh`
            * Archlinux: `openssh`
        </Callout>


        Use the **ssh-keygen** command to create a new pair of private and public keys:
        ```
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_cloud_key1
        ```
        You will be asked to specify the output file and passphrase for your key.

        Assuming your ssh public key is stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_cloud_key1.pub`:
        ```
        openstack keypair create --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa_my_cloud_key1.pub my_cloud_key1
        ```

        Refer to the [example of Key Pair creation](https://gitlab.ics.muni.cz/cloud/g2/openstack-infrastructure-as-code-automation/-/blob/master/clouds/g2/ostrava/general/commandline/cmdline-demo.sh) within VM provisioning CLI example.
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="GUI">
        <Callout type="error" title="Danger">
            Prefer using the `CLI` method unless you have no other choice, e.g., you lack access to a local machine
            with the `ssh-keygen` utility.

            The `GUI` method requires you to create your private key on a remote machine and transfer it over a network.
            Although both the remote machine and the network transfer should be secure, there is always some risk
            of a security breach, which could expose your private key to a malicious party.
        </Callout>


        __1.__ Navigate to **Project &gt; Compute &gt; Key Pairs** and click the **Create Key Pair** button.

        <Callout type="info" title="Example">
            ![](/img/openstack/instance/keypair1.png)
        </Callout>

        __2.__ In the **Create Key Pair** insert the **Key Pair Name**. Avoid using special characters, if possible. Next select SSH key for **Key Type** and finally confirm with **Create Key Pair**.

        <Callout type="info" title="Example">
            ![](/img/openstack/instance/keypair2.png)
        </Callout>

        __3.__ Download the private key to your local computer and move it to the `~/.ssh/` folder. If you are using Windows, refer to [Accessing From Windows](../technical-reference/remote-access.md#accessing-from-windows).

        __4.__ Set access privileges on `~/.ssh/` folder:

        ```
        chmod 700 .ssh/
        chmod 644 .ssh/id_rsa.pub
        chmod 600 .ssh/id_rsa
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Update Security Group

In MetaCentrum Cloud, all incoming traffic from external networks to virtual machine instances is blocked by default.
You need to explicitly allow access to virtual machine instances and services via a security group.

You need to add at least one new rule to be able to connect to your new instance (or any instance using the given security group).
This is similar to setting up firewall rules on your router or server. If set up correctly, you will be able to access
your virtual machine via SSH from your local terminal.

<Tabs items={["GUI", "CLI"]}>
    <Tab value="GUI">
        __1.__ Go to **Project &gt; Network &gt; Security Groups**. Click on **Manage Rules**, for the **default** security group.

        <Callout type="info" title="Example">
            ![](/img/openstack/instance/sec_group1.png)
        </Callout>

        __2.__ Click on **Add rule**, choose **SSH**, and leave the remaining fields unchanged.
        This will allow you to access your instance via IPv4.

        <Callout type="info" title="Example">
            ![](/img/openstack/instance/sec_group2.png)
        </Callout>

        <Callout type="warn" title="Caution">
            You have 2 possibilities for how to configure security groups policy.

            - One is through CIDR which specifies rules for concrete network range.
            - The second one specifies rules for members of a specified security group,
            i.e. policy will be applied on instances that belong to the selected security group.
        </Callout>

        For details, refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/train/user/configure-access-and-security-for-instances.html).
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="CLI">
        __1.__ Add SSH rule to the default security group:
            ```
            openstack security group rule create --description "Permit SSH" --remote-ip 0.0.0.0/0 --protocol tcp --dst-port 22 --ingress default
            ```

        Optionally, add ICMP rule (to allow ping):
            ```
            openstack security group rule create --description "Permit ICMP (any)" --remote-ip 0.0.0.0/0 --protocol icmp --icmp-type -1 --ingress default
            ```

        __2.__ Verify:
            ```
            openstack security group show default
            ```

                For personal project select personal-project-network-subnet from network `147-251-115-pers-proj-net`.
                Here is more information on available networks in [Brno G1](../technical-reference/brno-g1-site/networking.md#ipv4-personal-floating-ips)
                , [Ostrava G2](../technical-reference/ostrava-g2-site/networking.md#floating-ip-networks) and  [Brno G2](../technical-reference/brno-g2-site/networking.md#ipv4-personal-floating-ips).

        Volumes are created automatically when creating an instance in GUI, but we need to create them manually in the case of CLI.

        Create bootable volume from image (e.g. centos):
            ```
            openstack volume create --image "centos-7-1809-x86_64" --size 40 my_vol1
            ```

        To get a list of available images:
            ```
            openstack image list
            ```

            ```
            openstack server create --flavor "standard.small" --volume my_vol1 \
            --key-name my-key1 --security-group default --network 147-251-115-pers-proj-net my-server1
            ```

        To get a list of available flavors:
            ```
            openstack flavor list
            ```

        In case of a group project use `--network group-project-network`.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Associate Floating IP

Floating IP is the OpenStack name for a public IP. It makes the instance accessible from an external network (e.g., the Internet).

At this point, you want to [Allocate IP Address](../how-to-guides/managing-floating-ips.md#allocating-ip-address)
and [Assign IP Address](../how-to-guides/managing-floating-ips.md#assigning-ip-address).
You don't have to care about the other sections unless you need them.

Possible IP address pools are described separately for [Brno G1](../technical-reference/brno-g1-site/networking.md), [Ostrava G2](../technical-reference/ostrava-g2-site/networking.md)
and [Brno G2](../technical-reference/brno-g2-site/networking.md).

For group projects, always select the same network as used in
[Router gateway](../how-to-guides/create-router.md#router-creation).

## Login

Login using your SSH key as selected in Key pair above.

Connect to the instance using **ssh username@floating-ip**.

- `username` differs based on the selected image ("ubuntu", "debian", "centos", "almalinux"). The username topic is also discussed in [FAQ](../additional-information/faq.md).
- `floating-ip` is the one previously associated.

More information about login options is described on the [Accessing Instances](../how-to-guides/accessing-instances.md) page.

Refer to complete [example of creation VM and its components](https://gitlab.ics.muni.cz/cloud/g2/openstack-infrastructure-as-code-automation/-/blob/master/clouds/g2/ostrava/general/commandline/cmdline-demo.sh).


<Callout type="info" title="Info">
    On Linux and Mac, you can use the already present SSH client. On Windows, there are other possibilities for how to connect via SSH. One of the most common is [PuTTy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PuTTY) SSH client. How to configure and use PuTTy you can visit our [tutorial](../technical-reference/remote-access.md#accessing-from-windows).
